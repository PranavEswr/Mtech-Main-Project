# A-Generalised-Model-for-De-noising-Image-Dataset

- Aim is to create a CNN Model that can recognise and classify any kind of noisy image.
- Considering 3 noises ; 1) Salt & Pepper 2) Gaussian 3) Poisson
- And 2 optimizers, 1) Adam 2) SGD 
- These models are then compared to find the best.

(Given is a program of a model for poisson noise with SGD optimizer. Similarly performance for rest of the 5 models found by replacing optimizer and by adding other noises  )
